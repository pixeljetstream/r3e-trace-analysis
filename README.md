r3e-trace-analysis
==================

Tools to record, replay and inspect shared memory of [R3E](http://game.raceroom.com).
The project is not supported nor in anyway endorsed by the creators of R3E.

Â© 2015 by Christoph Kubisch, 

### **r3e-trace-record.exe**

Records all [shared memory](https://github.com/sector3studios/r3e-api) data of every session while the game is running (~10 ms pollrate) to a new file (e.g. "trace_151107_1750.r3t" ).
Start before running R3E, the tool terminates itself after R3E was closed.

Allows recording of the full session (for app developers), or only frames when driving (intended for telemetry analysis). 

### **RRRE.exe** 

Allows you to replay a trace, useful for debugging tools that also make use of the shared memory
bridge of R3E. Frame- or time-based replaying is supported. The state values get interpolated.

* Currently the replay rate is ~10 milliseconds
* All float values are linearly interpolated

### **r3e-trace-viewer.exe**

![ui](https://github.com/pixeljetstream/r3e-trace-analysis/blob/master/doc/ui.png)

A tool to open a trace file and inspect all data. Allows to browse through individual laps recorded within the session. Double-click a lap to make it active. Laps with "invalid" times (shortcuts...) are in brackets "()". The current selected lap is marked with "|||".

The current lap will be rendered in the track-view. The first valid lap of a file is drawn as fine line on top, as well as a marker with the current position.

Upon activation via double-click the driving line is shown (the default property). You can right-click another lap to compare the current property directly with the reference lap. The other lap's driving line will be rendered and colored by the difference to the original lap. Blue value means the other lap has a lower value than the reference lap. 
You can also modify the "Gradient" value prior the comparison to visualize where the differences changed.

Next to this projected comparison, you can also use the selectors (A,B,C,D) to compare different values or laps next or on top of each other. A selector change will not
cause any redraw, only selecting a lap or property will. With the "Animated driving line" feature 
you can improve the perception of the stippled driving lines.

When double-clicking a single property it is plotted in the track view. The current "Gradient" setting is applied, see explanation further down. It allows to visualize up- or down shifts for example.

Using the "Range" button, you can select to visualize a sub-range of the track. All plots will get cut
by the duration the fastest plot took. For example in this image you can see we lost a lot of time in the beginning of the track in lap 4 (lap 4's left side vs. lap 5's right side).

However when starting our analysis after the troubled section we can see that both laps ended up pretty similar in duration.

With "File->Append" one can load another set of recorded laps to compare with. However, there is no compatibility check whether the same car or track was used. Below we compare the fastest lap from race
with lap from qualifying.

![track_multifile](https://github.com/pixeljetstream/r3e-trace-analysis/blob/master/doc/track_multifile.png)

You can select interesting properties and export the current lap's interpolated values using the export button and create diagrams in your favorite chart software. How many sample points are taken is influenced by ```config.viewer.samplerate```.

![csvexport](https://github.com/pixeljetstream/r3e-trace-analysis/blob/master/doc/csvexport.png)

By modifying the "Gradient" value to greater 0, you can export the rate of change of values.
Positive values means the properties increased in the given gradient time span ( ```time +/- gradient * config.viewer.samplerate / 2```).

### Settings

The default settings are stored in "config.lua". Create "config-user.lua" to override those.

### History
* 15.08.2015:
 * Shaders using OpenGL 3.3 instead of 4.3 now
 * Added pan (drag left) and zoom (drag right)
* 29.07.2015:
 * direct comparison of laps via right-click in lapview
 * visual tweak to values that are within [0,1] to only use half of the color-range (pedal values look better)
* 26.07.2015:
 * Recorder supports saving session on pause (for mid-session files to be appended in viewer)
 * Support for appending a file
 * Improved styling of multiple data plots
 * Range option to compare limited sections of the track and their effect on time
* 25.07.2015:
 * Animated driving line
 * lap comparison via selector api
 * GLSL used for rendering, 8x msaa default
* 19.07.2015:
 * track view
 * csv file export
* 18.07.2015:
 * first version of trace viewer working
* 12.07.2015:
 * major revision in fileformat
 * improved detection of session begin/end
 * improved lap markers
 * allow "only driving" recordings, that filter away frames in game menu or driven by AI
* 11.07.2015: 
 * initial release

### Caveats

The Lua implemention of record and should be replaced by native C/C++ code to allow for greater sampling and playback rates. This is currently not a primary goal, as only few apps need high frequency data.
