r3e-trace-analysis
==================

Tools to record, replay and inspect shared memory of [R3E](http://game.raceroom.com).
The project is not supported nor in anyway endorsed by the creators of R3E.

### **r3e-trace-record.exe**

Records all [shared memory](https://github.com/sector3studios/r3e-api) data of every session while the game is running (~15 ms pollrate) to a new file (e.g. "trace_151107_1750.r3t" ).
Start before running R3E, the tool terminates itself after R3E was closed.

Allows recording of the full session (for app developers), or only frames when driving (intended for telemetry analysis). 

### **RRRE.exe** 

Allows you to replay a trace, useful for debugging tools that also make use of the shared memory
bridge of R3E. Frame- or time-based replaying is supported. The state values get interpolated.

* Currently the replay rate is ~15 milliseconds
* All float values are linearly interpolated

### **r3e-trace-viewer.exe**

![ui](https://github.com/pixeljetstream/r3e-trace-analysis/blob/master/doc/ui.png)

A tool to open a trace file and inspect all data. Allows to browse through individual laps recorded within the session.

TODO:

* OpenGL-based visualization of track and graphs for plotting data 
* Flexible expression editor what to visualize (raw values, gradients...)

### Settings

The default settings are stored in "config.lua". Directly edit or create "config-user.lua" to override those.

### History
* 18.07.2015:
 * first version of trace viewer working
* 12.07.2015:
 * major revision in fileformat
 * improved detection of session begin/end
 * improved lap markers
 * allow "only driving" recordings, that filter away frames in game menu or driven by AI
* 11.07.2015: 
 * initial release

### Caveats

The Lua implemention of record and should be replaced by native C/C++ code to allow for greater sampling and playback rates. This is currently not a primary goal, as only few apps need high frequency data.
